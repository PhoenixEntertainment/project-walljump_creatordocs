title: Flip switches
---

Flipswitches are a [Model](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Model) with a `PrimaryPart`, which contains a [HingeConstraint](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/HingeConstraint) to flip its associated [physics assembly](https://create.roblox.com/docs/physics/assemblies) back and forth when a player performs a singlejump.

**Requirements:**

- Custom switch panels are not allowed at this time. The switch panel from the creator's kit *must* be used.

**Example:** [ExampleSwitchPanel.rbxm](../Assets/ObstacleExamples/ExampleSwitchPanel.rbxm)
