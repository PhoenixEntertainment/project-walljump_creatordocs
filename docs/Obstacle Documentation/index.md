---

In Super Skyward Towers, there are various obstacles that players encounter in each section. These obstacles are what create the difficulty and challenge while beating a section. Often, obstacles are combined together to create new & unique obstacle types! Spinning rotating flamethrowers, moving flipswitches, quicksand pits, and more! There aren't a lot of creative limits on what types of obstacles you can make!
